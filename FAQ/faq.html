    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>What should I do if I damage the car?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In the event of accidents resulting in damage to the vehicle during the rental period, the user shall be required to pay the non-operation charge (NOC) as partial compensation for the loss of earnings incurred for repairs, regardless of the degree of damage or the length of time required for repairs.
The non-operation charge (NOC) is different from the deductible (paid by the user) in the insurance and compensation system, which is applied in the event of accidents. Please note that this sum is to be paid even if you are subscribed to the Safety Package.</p>
